File plot_odt.gnu is used with gnuplot as load 'plot.gnu', then hit enter to cycle through.
In odtParam.inp, set modDump to the frequency to output files after eddies occur.

File plotmeans.gnu likewise.

clear.sh will delete the data files (careful)

for parallel jobs each process dumps to data_myid (data_0, data_1 ...)
