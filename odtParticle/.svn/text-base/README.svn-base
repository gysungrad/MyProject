The ODT code is built as:

1. Edit the make.YOURMACHINE file for cantera paths and flags.
2. make clean
3. make depend
4. make MACH=YOURMACHINE (use a default make.MYWORKSTATION or create your own).
Note, you can edit the MACH variable at the top of the Makefile, then just type "make"

Build documentation as:

make doxygen

OR

"make MACH=MYWORKSTATION all" to do everything

WITH CANTERA, BE SURE TO SET THE PATHS IN make.YOURMACHINE
TO COMPILE WITHOUT CANTERA: set the CANTERA flag to NO in make.YOURMACHINE
Also be sure to turn off relevant reaction flags in the odtParam.inp and other input files.

Here are some instructions for building cantera on linux and mac.

The ODT code is set up to work with Cantera 1.7, 1.8, and 2.1

Cantera needs to be build for linking with C++.  The Matlab, Python, and Fortran interfaces
are not needed.  A minimal python (cantera) build is needed for processing cti files.

Basic instructions for 1.7, 1.8 (build from source):

1. Make sure you have python installed.
2. Download and untar Cantera (e.g. cantera-1.7.0).
3. Edit the preconfig file.  Set the desired path to install, other flags.
   You can use Cantera's included lapack/blas/cvode.  The ODT Makefile assumes this.
4. Type "./preconfig"
5. Type "make"
6. Type "make install" (or "sudo make install" depending on the install location)
7. The build puts a file called setup_cantera in the home directory.  This needs
   to be sourced (source it in your .bashrc file) to set environment variables.
   
   In some cases the following two lines are needed at the bottom of the setup_cantera file:

   PYTHONPATH=/home/you/codes/cantera/lib/python2.4/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
   export PYTHONPATH

   (use the appropriate python package).

8. In the make.MYWORKSTATION file, set the path to the Cantera include and lib files that
   the Cantera installation created.

Basic instructions for 2.1 (build from source):

1. Make sure you have python installed.
2. Get the code: http://code.google.com/p/cantera/source/checkout
3. Edit the cantera.conf file with desired flags. 
   (Backup the file and set flags in a cleaned cantera.conf file).  
   As for older versions, you just need a minimal python_package, and can use
   the cvode/lapack/blas that comes with Cantera.  The ODT Makefile assumes this.
4. Type "scons install"
5. add "source $HOME/canteraInstallDir/bin/setup_cantera" to your .bashrc file
6. In the make.MYWORKSTATION file, set the path to the Cantera include and lib files that
   the Cantera installation created.
