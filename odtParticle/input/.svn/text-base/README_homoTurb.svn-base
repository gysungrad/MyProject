Homogeneous turbulence decay.

Go to getRestartFile and run Matlab code oneDhomoTurb.m, then copy the restart_odtl.dat to this directory.

Copy the contents of this directory to the input directory (don't need to copy the getRestartFile dir.)

Note, make sure your domain length in odtParam.inp matches the restart file.  Make sure your smallest 
grid cell in odtParam.inp (dxmin) is smaller than eta (Kolmogorov length).  dxmin is scaled by the domain size,
so you will want dxmin < eta/Ldomain.  Set tend to be some multiple of the integral time scale.  The oneDhomoTurb.m
file outputs a lot of useful parameters.
